  Abstract                 = {A novel framework based on graph theory for structure discovery is applied to audio to find new types of audio objects which enable the compression of an input signal. It converts the sparse time-frequency representation of an audio signal into a graph by representing each data point as a vertex and the relationship between two vertices as an edge. Each edge is labelled based on a clustering algorithm which preserves a quality guarantee on the clusters. Frequent subgraphs are then extracted from this graph, via a mining algorithm, and recorded as objects. Tests performed using a corpus of audio excerpts show that the framework discovers new types of audio objects which yield an average compression gain of 23.53\% while maintaining high audio quality.},

  Abstract                 = {The impact of auditory masking when obtaining sparse representations for audio signals is investigated by integrating a masking model into a Locally Competitive Algorithm. The masking model considers both temporal and frequency domain masking effects. The performance of the new algorithm is verified against the original Locally Competitive Algorithm for different types of sound files. Results show that the new algorithm allows for larger residual error between an input signal and its reconstructed version while maintaining the broadcast quality of the reconstructed version. It does so by shaping the residual error such that this larger error is inaudible.},
